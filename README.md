You can call me Kri or by the skin I use (you can use a nickname if we're close enough).
She/her
I'm often too shy or stressed to make the first move, so if you really want to talk, just talk or whisper to me, I'll 100% respond (unless I'm AFK or you're weird with me) 
Always C+H and int friendly! Even if it's not always written in the name of my skins, unless I have a dni/dniuf or something like that, it's often because I'm overwhelmed and please dni in those cases.
The South Park or MHA fandom, please DNI unless I do it first. I've had very bad experiences with these fandoms, so I'd rather avoid them unless I really int first.
I'm ADHD,autistic, neurodivergent in general and English isn't my first language, so sorry if I'm a little awkard...also I sometimes have trouble to recognises sarcasm etc so i need TONETAGS a lot.

I can joke about my trauma to cope. I also have mental illnesses, but I prefer to laugh about it rather than cry. Sometimes I can get overwhelmed and be mean and/or react differently without realizing it, so if that really bothers you, int with caution?
